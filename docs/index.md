# Welcome

Welcome to Star Find

## Rules

**Be Respectful** – No spamming, trolling, flaming, offensive language, disruptive behavior, etc.

**Be Helpful** – Share reports of all stars you appear at (even if not mining), help scope/list/scout stars and answer questions. You may report star locations given to you by others, but you are responsible for the report's accuracy. (See post 1.06 for reporting guidelines)

**Keep the list of unfound stars within the friends chat** - People work hard to make lists for everyone in the friends chat to use. If someone wants to hunt stars, please invite them to join the chat.

**Lobby** - Though being in lobby is not against the rules, if chat is full, lobby sitters will be the first to be removed to make room for active players.

These rules are not exhaustive and may be expanded upon by ranks.
